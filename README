Django Gidgits (widgets)!

Quite handy for known data outputs (like tables, pies, graphs etc) that you
want to include in a template but don't want to add to the context of the view
in which the template is rendered. This just handles it all, meaning all the
code is in one place and you just modify the render_to_response and a couple of
other bits and it all 'just works' - pulls in CSS, JS etc.

Docs need a few fixes... they are a little out of date.

Notably, by convention, if including JS that needs to be fired after render, we
use a custom trigger ('widgetsReady') that is bound using $.one so that it only
fires once (multiple widgets on the page can cause problems otherwise).
